# Docker and Dev Containers

Do **not** start or run:

- Docker containers (e.g. `docker-compose up`, `docker run`, `make docker/up`)
- Dev containers or dev servers that run in the background

unless the user has explicitly asked you to do so or given permission.

If a task would require starting containers or long-running dev processes, propose the command or steps and ask the user to run them, or wait for them to confirm before executing.
